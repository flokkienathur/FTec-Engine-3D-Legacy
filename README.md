# FTec Engine 3D (Legacy)

Some old code I wrote in 2014 (I think). Never uploaded it to github, but why should I not just share this.

NOTE: The 3D lighting shader worked when testing this code 2 years ago. It does not work anymore, at least not on my current hardware. I won't be fixing this, this is only for legacy purposes.
