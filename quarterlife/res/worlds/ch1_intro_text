Sample text.

Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that 
you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest than you.
And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until.... Well lets 
just say your hour has come again. The right man in the wrong place can make 
all the difference in the world. So wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the 
ashes.
